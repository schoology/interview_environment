# Project Overview

In order to effectively assess applicants in a variety of languages, we needed a fast way to setup technology stacks ready to be developed on. This project aims to do just that. There are three directories each containing a Vagrantfile that will provision a box ready to be developed on in that language. After setting Vagrant and Virtualbox up (outlined below) you can read more about setting up your chosen environment in the README's specific to that environment. Those README's also describe a bit about the frameworks used in the environment

* [The PHP Box](php/)
* [The Ruby Box](ruby/)
* [The Python Box](python/)

# Prerequisites
1. Ensure your host computer has the following minimum specifications:
   * __Memory:__ 4Gb
   * __CPUs:__ 4vCPUs

2. git needs to be installed on your machine so this repository can be checked out and submodules can be included

3. Download and install [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) which is the default virtualization technology used by vagrant.

4. Download and install [viagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) which should be considered a driver, or front-end for various virtualization technologies (e.g. VirtualBox).

5. Once vagrant and virtualbox are installed, open up a command line and execute the following (note: In windows you should make sure vagrant is in your PATH environment variable).
        
         vagrant plugin install vagrant-omnibus
         vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest

   Installing the vagrant-vbguest plugin is necessary to ensure that vagrant checks that the version of VirtualBox Guest       Additions installed on the guest operating system matches the version of VirtualBox being used to run the virtual       machine. In cases where the VirtualBox Guest Addtions version does not match the version of VirtualBox, you may see vagrant report errors or have trouble providing basic functionality such as networking or mapping of shared drives.

6. Finally, clone this repo and checkout any submodules

         git submodule init
         git submodule update

# Vagrant Overview

[Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) is a tool to programmatically manipulate and provision virtualboxes.

To start the Virtualbox and run any provisioning run

      vagrant up

 
To simply provision an already running box run

      vagrant provision
    
To get a shell connection within the virtualbox run 

      vagrant ssh
      
**Note** - if you are running this on a Windows machine you will not have ssh available to you. You can use a client like [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/) to connect to the box. The connection credentials for the client will look like:

* **Host**: 127.0.0.1
* **Port**: 2222
* **Username**: vagrant
* **Password**: vagrant

# Connecting to MySQL
Each flavor of virtualbox has MySQL installed. To connect from the host machine you can connect using the following credentials

* **Host**: 127.0.0.1 (e.g. localhost to your workstation)
* **Port**: 3310 
* **Username**: interview
* **Password**: interview
